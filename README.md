I’m Dylan, a software developer and musician with a persistent curiosity for how things work. I enjoy exploring the intersection between code, maths, and sound—often building musical tools in my spare time—and I’m always learning, experimenting, and collaborating with others along the way.

My most recent side projects have been:
- An open-source library called [Meantonal](https://meantonal.org/) for representing musical pitch in a *semantically non-destructive* way, using linear algebra to make operations that are challenging to achieve with other libraries trivial. I wrote both a C and a TypeScript implementation, making it suitable in desktop, web, or even embedded musical applications.
- [A melody and counterpoint generator](https://cantussy.com/), which uses both the C and TypeScript versions of Meantonal to wrangle and render pitches, and [Verovio](https://verovio.org/) for score-rendering and the [Web Audio API](https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/API/Web_Audio_API) for playback. The melody and counterpoint generation code is written in C and compiled to WASM, and called via JavaScript in the browser.
- (WIP) A [graphical text editor](https://github.com/dylancobb/text-editor) based on the architecture of Emacs and Neovim. Written in C using [SDL3](https://libsdl.org/) for cross-platform rendering and input, [Clay](https://www.nicbarker.com/clay) for layout/UI, and [Chibi Scheme](https://synthcode.com/scheme/chibi/) as the embedded interpreted language that will provide user configurability extensibility.
